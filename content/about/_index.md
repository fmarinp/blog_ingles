I am a data scientist currently working in Melbourne, Australia. 

I was born and raised in Santiago, Chile. From a young age I took an interest in physics, maths and the Universe, 
and I started a learning journey that took me to many diverse places and to meet great people. 
I finished my undegraduate degree at Universidad de Chile and shortly thereafter 
I moved to the United States to grad school in the University of Chicago, where I worked
in large surveys of galaxies and numerical simulations. In 2010 I moved to work as a postdoc at Swinburne 
University in Melbourne.

Some years ago I made the decision to change careers to the industry, and I have worked in different 
topics ranging from train network simulation to job matching using text analytics.

You can see my resume [here](/data/felipe_resume_q_jan19.pdf) 

Iâ€™m a proud father of a boy and a girl,
and in my free time I enjoy running, listening (and dancing!) to all kinds of music, a good novel,
or just enjoying a good TV show.
