The main area of interest in my academic life was observational cosmology, that is, the analysis of astronomical phenomena to help us model the origin and evolution of the Universe. There are many observables that can help us understand the cosmological evolution of the universe: I focused on the information that can be obtained from large surveys of galaxies.

The scientific study of the origins and evolution of the Universe in their modern form started around the 1920s – with the General Theory of Relativity on the theoretical front and from the discovery of the expanding universe on the observational one (paradoxically aided by the other great invention in physics: Quantum theory). But only in the later part of the last century the technology caught up in order for scientists to be able to statistically study the properties of the Universe.

Using the spectral information of the galaxies we can infer their distance and in that way create a 3-d map of these galaxies. As can be seen from a map of one of the pioneer surveys, 2dF, the galaxies on large distances are not smoothly distributed – galaxies tend to cluster, and moreover, they tend to cluster along filaments and walls. Quantifying the galaxy clustering can give us great information not only on the way galaxies form but in the underlying cosmological model.

I worked with several galaxy samples from primarily the SDSS and WiggleZ surveys, measuring spatial clustering statistics. In particular I was (and am!) very interested in the so-called 3-point correlation function of galaxies (3PCF). Whereas the 2-point correlations (2PCF) measure the (excess) probability of separation of two galaxies – and it has been proven extremely important in shaping our understanding of the cosmological model, the 3PCF measures the excess probability of finding triangles, with galaxies as vertices, in the galaxy distribution – they give us additional information as they are sensitive to the shape of the clustering- below a figure of the 3PCF for  a sample of massive galaxies. The triangles  here have sides 20/40 Mpc (1 Mpc = 3.26 million light-years!)  and the 3PCF is measured as a function of the angle between these two sides. As expected from the filamentary clustering there is more excess probability on the small and large angles.

Combining the information from the 2PCF and 3PCF can help us understand the relationship between the galaxy population and the underlying matter medium where they are formed (galaxy bias) and in that way help us constrain cosmological models.
