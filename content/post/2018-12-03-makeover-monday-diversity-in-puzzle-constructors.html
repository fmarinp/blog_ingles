<p>This week the challenge was to explore a dataset of women who contributed to the New York Times crossword along the years, during the tenure of Will Shortz.</p>
<p>In the original <a href="https://www.xwordinfo.com/Women">article</a> it was palpable the under-representation by female contributors: From 922 puzzle constructors only 223 were women.</p>
<p>I load the following packages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#load libraries
library(plotly)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(data.world) #where data lives</code></pre>
<p>I create a custom function for the animation</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accumulate_by &lt;- function(dat, var) {
  var &lt;- lazyeval::f_eval(var, dat)
  lvls &lt;- plotly:::getLevels(var)
  dats &lt;- lapply(seq_along(lvls), function(x) {
  cbind(dat[var %in% lvls[seq(1, x)], ], frame = lvls[[x]])
  })
  dplyr::bind_rows(dats)
}</code></pre>
<p>Then I add the percentage of women for each day per year</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#let&#39;s get percentage of women
dataPlot &lt;- raw_data %&gt;% 
  mutate(percWomen = round(women/(women+men)*100,2),
         percMen = round(men/(women+men)*100,2)) 

dataPlot$weekday &lt;- factor(dataPlot$weekday,
              levels = c(&#39;Mon&#39;,&#39;Tue&#39;,&#39;Wed&#39;,&#39;Thu&#39;,&#39;Fri&#39;,&#39;Sat&#39;,&#39;Sun&#39;))
dataPlot %&lt;&gt;% 
  mutate(nWeek = as.numeric(weekday))

#stats per year
dataYear &lt;- dataPlot %&gt;% 
  mutate(yeardate  = year) %&gt;%
  group_by(yeardate) %&gt;%
  summarise(percWomen = mean(percWomen, na.rm=T)) %&gt;%
  accumulate_by(~yeardate) %&gt;%
  mutate(year=frame)</code></pre>
<p>The code below build the two side-to-side plots and the bar</p>
