One of the things I love to do but can't find enough time to do nowadays is to read books. It's not only
finding the time but also making the time when there are so many distractions after a day of work or when
the kids go to bed. I estimate I've read around 300-350 books in my life, but in the last 
few years I felt that I was lacking a rythym and was reading far few books, seeing my personal library
accumulate unread books, as well as leaving too many books unread or taking too long to 
finish a book when I felt it was being a drag. 

So last year (2018) I wanted to take on setting a goal in terms of books read that keeps me active and 
on pace. As I have a 
[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) account, I decided to take on the "Reading Challenge" and 
I set to finish 30 books in 2018. In this case, "reading" means both actual reading from books and
e-books, but also includes listening audiobooks, or a mix of both. 

To give this blog a data-science-y flavour, at the end of the year I donwloaded my list of books read for 
2018 and created a _shiny Rmarkdown (flex)dashboard_. If you are unfamiliar with that last expression, let's 
unpack it:

  * [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that makes interactive web apps from R(Studio).
  * [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) is a RMarkdown template that makes
  sleek dashboards.

Some insights: 

* I read 31 books in 2018 - not bad!
