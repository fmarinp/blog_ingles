<p>It was my first participation in <a href="https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/">#MakeoverMonday</a>, a weekly workshop where participants submit different visualisations from a dataset available for that week. It’s a great initiative and a way to discover and practice new ways of communicating insights from data.</p>
<p>Usually the submissions are made in <a href="https://public.tableau.com/">Tableau Public</a> as the authors of the blog are “Tableau Zen Masters”. I have used Tableau a few times, and it’s certainly in my wish list to learn, but since I have a bit of practice and it’s more relevant for work I will be using <a href="https://plot.ly/r/">plotly in R</a> to generate these visuals, although it make time some more time as there is more coding involved.</p>
<p>This week the theme was <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/cost-of-a-night-out-cities-around-the-world">‘The cost of a night out’</a> from selected cities around the world. The original plot show the cost of a ‘club’ night out, itemising costs of club entry, a ‘Big Mac’, taxi and two drinks. The costs vary greatly, from a highest average cost of $93 in Zurich, while the lowest was in Mexico city where a party night for two costs $20 on average.</p>
<p>The data that could be used included also the average costs of a ‘date night’ out. I wanted to include both costs in the visual, which I will generate in plotly. To start, let’s load the libraries</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#load libraries
library(plotly)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)</code></pre>
<p>I downloaded the data, but using the package <code>data.world</code> it is possible to grab the data directly from the web.</p>
<p>The plot I have in mind is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_diagram">“tornado diagram”</a>, where I will the itemised costs of a night out for the different cities.</p>
<p>The ‘tornado’ look is given by sorting the total costs in descending order. I do some basic manipulation in <code>dplyr</code> to get the total cost by category and city, so I can put the city with the most expensive date night on top:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#get ranking of cities by cost of date night
rank_cities &lt;- ubs_data %&gt;%
  filter(Category == &#39;Date night&#39;) %&gt;%
  group_by(City) %&gt;% 
  summarise(totalCost = sum(Cost)) %&gt;%
  arrange(totalCost) %&gt;%
  select(City) %&gt;% pull()

#City as factor sorted by date night cost
ubs_data$City  = factor(ubs_data$City, levels = rank_cities)

#order items as well.
ubs_data$Item  = factor(ubs_data$Item, 
                        levels = c(&quot;Dinner&quot; ,&quot;Drinks at Dinner&quot;,
                                   &quot;Cinema entry&quot;, &quot;Taxi&quot;, 
                                   &quot;Big Mac&quot;,&quot;Club entry&quot;, 
                                   &quot;2 Longdrinks&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>I will use <code>plotly</code> to generate the figure. First, I organise my data frame in a way that I can plot both date nights and party nights at the same level. In this case, the party nights will be on the negative side of x</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dataPlot &lt;- ubs_data %&gt;% 
  mutate(MyCost = ifelse(Category == &#39;Date night&#39;, Cost, -Cost)) 

#this makes the ticks on the negative side to show positive sign
tick_vals = c(-100,-50,0,50,100,150,200)
tick_labels = c(&#39;100&#39;,&#39;50&#39;,&#39;0&#39;,&#39;50&#39;,&#39;100&#39;,&#39;150&#39;,&#39;200&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>For the color palette, I choose shades of blue for the date night, shades of red for party night using <a href="https://moderndata.plot.ly/create-colorful-graphs-in-r-with-rcolorbrewer-and-plotly/"><code>colorRampPalette</code></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>#date night
b &lt;- colorRampPalette(c(&quot;lightslateblue&quot;,&quot;skyblue&quot;))
myBlues &lt;- b(3)

#party night
r &lt;- colorRampPalette(c(&#39;firebrick1&#39;,&#39;salmon1&#39;))
myReds &lt;- r(4)</code></pre>
<p>I also want to show a link for the source data as an annotation</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- list(
  x = -0.05,
  y = -0.1,
  text = &quot;Source: &lt;a href=&#39;https://www.ubs.com/microsites/prices-earnings/en/stories/7-dinner-in-paris-party-in-miami-the-cheapest-and-priciest-cities-for-a-night-out/&#39;&gt;UBS&lt;/a&gt;&quot;,
  xref = &quot;paper&quot;,
  yref = &quot;paper&quot;,
  showarrow = FALSE
)</code></pre>
<p>Finally the call, adding title - and the plot!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p&lt;- plot_ly() %&gt;%
  add_bars(data= dataPlot,
          x = ~MyCost,
          y = ~City,
          group = ~Item,
          type = &#39;bar&#39;,
          showLegend = TRUE,
          text  = ~paste0(Item,&quot;: $&quot;,Cost),
          hoverinfo = &#39;text&#39;,
          orientation = &#39;h&#39;,
          marker = list(
            color = factor(dataPlot$Item,
                    labels=c(myBlues, myReds))))%&gt;%
  layout(barmode = &#39;relative&#39;,
         xaxis = list(title= &quot;Cost ($USD)&quot;,
                tickvals = tick_vals, ticktext= tick_labels),
         yaxis = list(title = &quot;&quot;),
         title = &#39;Makeover Monday 48: Cost of a night out around the world&#39;,
         margin = list(l = 100, r = 20, t = 70, b = 70),
         paper_bgcolor = &#39;rgb(248, 248, 255)&#39;,
         plot_bgcolor = &#39;rgb(248, 248, 255)&#39;,
         annotations = a,
         width = 650, 
         height = 500)</code></pre>
<p>Voila !</p>
